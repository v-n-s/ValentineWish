			Ever since we started “git init” we have so many good memories to save together in our own hidden file that we can look back on through ls -la. I like how we can keep each other updated with git status. Sometimes it can be annoying to have to git add . before we can commit. Remember when we were in that cute coffee shop and we agreed that we would git commit with the message -m "first commit". When I add to our repository I always make sure to  add my files then Commit with a -m to remind me of what I have changed. I can look back on all of our times togeher the git log.My favorite part about us is your ability to be flexible. When I go explore new items in a git branch you are  always so supportive. If I find something that improves our relationship all I need to do is a simple git merge to replace the older files. Even when we have differences of option I can git diff to see where we don’t agree. I love the fact that when I make a big mistake I use a git checkout to reverse changes. An advance feature I appreciate about you is your ability to rebase to the master. Instead of using a merge commit, rebasing re-writes the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch. Git you are truly something special.
