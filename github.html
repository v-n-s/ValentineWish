     Dear GitHub,
    </span>

    <p id="message">
      I like how you make things easy. I loved meeting your <strong> Octocat </strong> and hearing stories about when the she was sent to other people’s computers when a server has a problem or when a user requests a link that doesn’t exist. I think it’s really fun how you provide a <strong>platform for me and my friends to work on coding projects simultaneously </strong>. I also love how you support me by giving me some space to show my <strong> repos </strong> off to the world . With a simple <strong> cd into a local git project and the simple remote URL</strong> from you I have the freedom to improve on my project with a simple <strong> git push</strong>. I’m so thankful you can keep everything safe and convenient by only asking me to login once per an open terminal window. One of my favorite advantages of this open relationship is the freedom to <strong>collaborate with others through versioning </strong>. Thank goodness you have <strong> branches </strong> where I can experiment with different additions to my projects then <strong> merge </strong> everything back into the <strong> master </strong> . When I’m feeling adventurous I love how you let me take projects in a completely different direction through a <strong> fork </strong>. I’m so glad you always have my back and keep all my files updated when I <strong> add, commit, and push to you </strong> . GitHub, you are one of a kind. You really create a community of knowledge and support, and that is such an amazing gift to the world. 
      <br>
      P.S. I love our little secret way to navigate around each other by using your URL like the command line.
